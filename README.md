# loan-predictor-kcbf
This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan approval using a binary classification approach. We'll use the "Loan Approval Dataset" from Kaggle training Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models and evaluating them with various metrics. Submission requires a GitHub repository with the code, a project report, and a README.md file.
